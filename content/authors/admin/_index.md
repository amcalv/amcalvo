# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I was born in Madrid where I studied Mechanical Engineering, a Master degree in Applied Mathematics, and a Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Alejandro Sevilla at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I will join the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Fall, 2021. My past and some of my current research lie within the field of fluid dynamics, and more specifically small-scale interfacial flows, surface and bulk rheology, and fluid-structure interaction at the microscale, among others. Currently I am exploring new directions within the field of biophysics and active matter.

interests:
- Free-surface flows
- Surface rheology
- Fluid-structure interaction at low Reynolds numbers
